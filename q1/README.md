# Question 1 â€” Fill in the blanks (program structure, variables, comments, basic I/O)

Objective

Fill in the marked parts of `q1.cpp` (look for comments that say `// FILL HERE`) so that the program compiles and produces the exact expected output.

What this tests

- Correct program structure (includes, main function)
- Declaration and initialization of variables
- Use of comments and basic output with `std::cout`

Instructions

1. Open `q1/q1.cpp` and find the comments that say `// FILL HERE`.
2. Replace each `// FILL HERE` with the correct code described by the nearby comment.
3. Do NOT change the text in the `std::cout` statements unless instructed.
4. Compile and run the program. The output must match the expected output exactly.

Expected output

The program should print:

```
Welcome to C++ exercises!
Name: Alice
Age: 20
GPA: 3.75
```

Hints

- Use appropriate data types: `std::string` for names, integer types for age, and `double` or `float` for GPA.
- Make sure to include the correct header(s) and use `std::` where necessary.
