# CPP-Task1 — Introductory C++ Exercises

This repository contains two beginner-friendly C++ exercises built around the following topics:

1. Introduction to C++, installing VS Code, g++ & more
2. Basic structure of a C++ program
3. Variables & comments in C++
4. Variable scope & data types in C++
5. C++ basic input/output

Work to complete

- q1: A short fill-in-the-blanks exercise focusing on program structure, variables, comments, and simple I/O.
- q2: A small full-program exercise that practices data types, scope, and basic input/output.

Each question lives in its own folder (`q1/`, `q2/`) and contains:

- `qX.cpp` — the source (either a template with "fill here" comments or a blank starter file).
- `README.md` — clear instructions, input/outputs, and what to fill/implement.

How to compile & run (macOS / zsh):

```bash
# compile
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra q1/q1.cpp -o q1/q1
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra q2/q2.cpp -o q2/q2

# run
./q1/q1
./q2/q2
```

What to submit

- Edit the `q1/q1.cpp` and `q2/q2.cpp` files to implement the solutions requested in their READMEs.
- Commit and push your changes to **YOUR FORKED REPOSITORY**.

Grading hints

- Correctness: output must match the expected sample output in each question's README.
- Readability: use meaningful variable names and comments.
- Demonstration of concepts: show that you understand program structure, variables, scope, and basic I/O.

Proceed to the `q1/` and `q2/` folders and complete the exercises in order.
